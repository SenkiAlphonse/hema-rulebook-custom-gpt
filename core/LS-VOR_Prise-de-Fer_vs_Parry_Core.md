# FIE Core — Actions on the Blade (Beat / Engagement / Prise de fer) vs Parries (Right of Way)

This document explains how refereeing practice distinguishes:
- **Actions on the blade** (attaque au fer, prise de fer; including beat / pengeütés / ütés, bind/engagement / kötés/pengekötés)
from
- **Parries** (defensive actions that stop an incoming attack),
and how these relate to **Right of Way (RoW)** in foil and sabre.

This is intended as a practical referee-and-coach clarification, not historical theory.

## 1) Key Principle: “Attack on the blade” / "pengetámadás" / "Attaque au fer" is not automatically a parry

### Attacks on the blade (Prise de Fer (pengekötés), Battement (pengeütés))
These are **offensive tools** used to:
- remove or control the opponent’s blade,
- disrupt a line (point in line),
- prevent the opponent from setting up defense/counteroffense,
- prepare or secure the follow-up hit.

They are often used as part of compound attacks, typically connected to the attack as **one unit** (attaque au fer (pengetámadás) → immediate attack), often without a visible break.

**Important:** an attack on the blade is judged by its *role in the phrase*:
- is it part of a continuous attack?
- does it clearly remove the opponent’s threat/line?
- does it set up a follow-up hit without hesitation?

(Attack prepared by deflecting the blade is common FIE practice: “attack on the blade / attack au fer”.) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Parries
A parry is a **defensive action** whose purpose is to **prevent the incoming attack from arriving**.

Referee test:
- If there is no incoming attack to stop, you are not “parrying” in the strict sense; you are doing blade work (engagement/beat), or preparation.

(General explanation of “parry = defender deflects an attack.”) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 2) What an attack on the blade (pengetámadás) DOES in RoW / VOR terms 

### Beat (ütés) or engagement (kötés) as part of an attack
If a fencer:
- makes a takes the blade (with a beat (ütés) or engagement (kötés)),
- and immediately attacks as one continuous action,

this is treated as a **correctly executed attack** (attack prepared by blade action).

The rules explicitly addresses beat-attacks: an attack by beating on the blade **retains priority** when executed correctly. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

**Practical meaning:**
- The beat supports the attacker’s existing initiative.
- It is used to disrupt the defender’s preparation to parry, counterattack, or maintain a line.

### Beat to remove Point in Line
A mere blade contact is not enough: a line must be *deflected* (displaced) for the attack to be valid against it. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**Practical meaning:**
- “touching the blade” ≠ removing the line
- the beat must clearly take the threatening point away

**WARNING, Failure of the attempt to take the blade is similar to missing/failing the attack:**
When an attacker attempts to take the blade but misses/falls short, it gives the right of way to the opponent who can immediately launch their own attack. This is also true when the attacker tries to take the defender's blade, but the defender avoids the attempt by disengaging. 

---

## 3) What a Beat DOES NOT do

### A beat is not automatically a “parry”
A beat is normally an **offensive** blade action, not a defensive stopping of an incoming cut/thrust.

If you are using a beat “to stop a real incoming attack,” what matters is whether the action actually functions as a parry (i.e., it prevents the hit). If it does, referees may treat it as a parry in phrase terms (defense succeeded), but mechanically it may still look like a beat.

In other words:
- **classification is phrase-role based**, not just the name of the movement.

---

## 4) The Forte/Foible issue 

The rules explicitly discuss beat quality in terms of *where* the beat lands:

### t.78 — Attacks by beats on the blade (Foil rules text)
- A beat-attack or engagement-attack retains priority when the beat is made on the **foible** (weak / gyenge) of the opponent’s blade. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
- When the beat or engagement is made on the **forte** (strong / erős) of the opponent’s blade, the implication is that the blade action has not successfully displaced the opponent’s weapon in the intended way; refereeing practice treats this as the attack on the blade (pengetámadás) being effectively “met” or neutralized. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

**Important correction to common myths:**
- Referees are not judging metallurgy.
- The forte/foible language is a shorthand for whether the beat meaningfully controlled/removed the opponent’s blade.

So if a beat slides down and ends up “on the forte,” the practical referee conclusion is:
- the beat did not achieve blade control in the intended line,
- the defender’s blade action can be treated as having neutralized it,
- the attacker does not automatically get RoW “for free.”

## 5) Engagements / prises de fer are not parries (and why that matters)

### Engagement / bind / kötés (prise de fer family)
These are blade controls intended to:
- constrain the opponent’s blade,
- set up a safe final action,
- create a predictable line for the hit.

They are typically **offensive preparation** or **attack construction**, not defense against a fully launched attack.

(Prise-de-fer / attack-on-blade families are standard fencing vocabulary.) :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

### Why this matters in RoW teaching
Many adults misread:
- “blade contact” as “parry happened”
or
- “fast second hit after blade contact” as “I regained priority”

The practice:
- RoW depends on **who is attacking / who successfully parries / who ripostes immediately**.
- Blade actions (beat/engagement) matter because they shape whether the attack is considered continuous and whether the defender’s options were removed—not because “any beat = a parry.”

---

## 6) “Beating the blade gives you RoW when defending” — the precise interpretation

This statement needs phrasing carefully.

### What is true in phrase logic
If you are *not* the attacker and you make a successful attack on the opponent's blade (beat or engagement), 
it terminates the opponent's attack and gives you the right to immediately launch your own attack.

---

## 7) Simultaneous attacks on the blade (“both beat at the same time”)

The practice is phrase-structural:

- If one fencer is already clearly the attacker, a simultaneous blade action usually does **not** automatically cancel their initiative; the call is still made from attack structure.”
- If neither is clearly attacking (both preparing), simultaneous blade actions do not by themselves grant RoW; RoW goes to the fencer who then makes the first **properly initiated attack**.

Practical teaching line:
- “Simultaneous attack on the blade (by both opponents at once) doesn’t magically flip priority. Priority flips on parry-riposte, successful one-sided beat or engagement by the defender, or on abandonment of the attack.”

---
## 8) Important note

- When we talk about 'gaining the Right of Way' through an action, it is always for the next move, without break, hesitation, withdrawal, retreat.
- if, instead of starting offensive action, a fencer retreats further, hesitates, draws back/up or lowers the blade without establishing threat, they can lose the RoW / priority again.
- Priority works a bit like a zero-sum game. In the beginning nobody has it, then someone initiates, then if they make a mistake the opponent has the right for the immediate response (riposte/initiative), and so on, until one of them manages to conclude a successful action (either finish the prioritized attack, or perform a counterattack, or parry-riposte).
- the attacker has the physical advantage, that the defender must react to, and work with, the attacker's moves. As long as the attack is uninterrupted (by the attacker's mistake or by the defending opponent), the attack retains priority.
- However, if the attacker hesitates, makes a mistake that breaks the flow of the attack, the defender can **take over the initiative** if they can be in the right mind and position to do so. This requires a good control of footwork, distance, and often even anticipation, because they need to both work with the attacker's moves, and try to disrupt them at the same time. They can't afford to get hit in these moments. So: if the defender can control themselves well enough that they are able to immediately take advantage of the attacker's break/imstake/interruption/hesitation, they can take over the initiative, and initiate their own offensive action at that moment. But if the defender retreats farther or hesitate instead of taking over, the (former)attacker can (and usually will) renew their attack and regain the priority.
- and this "game of tennis" with the priority goes on until a valid hit happens, or rarely, until for some reason the fencers disengage, lose the flow of the action, and someone needs to initiate again.

## 9) Quick referee classification test

Ask:
1) Was there a real incoming attack to stop?
   - If yes, and blade action prevented it → treat as parry.
   - If no → it’s attack on the blade (beat/engagement), i.e., attack construction or counter-preparation.

2) Did the blade action clearly remove the opponent’s line/threat?
   - If yes → attack on blade can be valid and retain/gain priority (t.78 / point-in-line deflection rule).
   - If no (mere, especially accidental contact) → do not treat it as meaningful deflection.

Anchors: t.78 (beat attacks), point-in-line deflection principle.
