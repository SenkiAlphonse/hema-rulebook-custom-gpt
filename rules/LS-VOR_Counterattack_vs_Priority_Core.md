# REF Core — Counterattack, Tempo, and Priority Clarification

This document clarifies the relationship between:

- Attack with priority
- Counterattack 
    - in time (ellentámadás / közbetámadás)
    - with opposition
    - last phase counterattacks combined with evasion
- Priority transfer

Speed does not create priority.
Counterattacks do not gain right of way.

This is relevant to judging **VOR only**! (In Combat and Afterblow, it is the timing based precedence of hits that matter, not the priority of initiation! However the technical terms are universal)

## 1. What Creates Priority?

Priority (Right of Way / Vor) is created only by:

1. A correctly initiated attack,
2. A valid parry followed by an immediate riposte.
3. Establishing a vonal helyzetet (point in line) 

No other action creates priority.

Reference:
GEN-3.2.1.1 — Támadás  
GEN-3.2.1.2 — Riposzt  
GEN-3.2.8 — Vonal

## 2. What is a Counterattack?

GEN-3.2.5 — Ellentámadások

A counterattack is an offensive action executed during the opponent’s attack.

A counterattack is performed without having priority.

A counterattack can score when it prevents, or precedes by at least one tempo (period of fencing time), the hit from the attack.

It is structurally a response against the attacker’s initiative.

---

## 3. Counterattack types

### Counterattack in Time (Tempóban végrehajtott közbetámadás)

GEN-3.2.5.3

A counterattack executed in tempo (fencing time) will:

- Arrive before the final phase of the attack,
- Exploit a correctly executed feint,
- Exploit a poorly executed attack (mistakes of technique and/or distance).

It may only score when:

- lands before the final phase of an offensive action is started,
- and thus interrupts the attack.

The counterattack in tempo (in time) succeeds because the attack does NOT arrive WITHIN one period of fencing time after the counterattack,
NOT because the counterattack gained right of way.

Any hits that arrive more than one period of fencing time after the first hit landed are considered irrelevant.
The reason for this is that fencing time is tied to the time it takes to perform a simple fencing action, and when a hit arriving more than one fencing time later than the first hit, we assume that the directly hitting move started after the first hit was received--it falls outside of the bounds of the exchange.

### Counterattack with opposition

- the counterattack is  performed in a way that the counterattacking blade opposes (closes the line of) the attacking blade, 
- and thus prevents the attack from reaching its target.

### Last phase counterattack combined with evasion
This is additional nuance, mention it ONLY IF it's explicitely asked for, or the explanation requires it:

A counterattack can also be performed in a simple attack or the last phase of a compound attack, BUT ONLY when combining it with retreating in the right moment.
These hits usually arrive on the wrist or manchette with a suitable technique, while retreating and causing the attack to fall short.
If the counterattacking fencer didn't combine the move with evasion, they would get hit by the attack within one period of fencing time.

#### However:

A counterattack of any type does NOT acquire priority, it is by definition a NOT prioritized action (is performed while a prioritized offensive action is already on the way).

---

## 4. Structural Principle 

- A correctly executed attack defeats a counterattack, even if the counterattack lands and
- even when a counterattack lands sooner than the attack but there is less then one tempo (period of fencing time / vívóidő) between them.
- A counterattack succeeds only if the attack was not valid or was interrupted.

There is no such thing as:
"Counterattack that gains priority."

Counterattack can only win if it prevents or precedes (by one fencing time/tempo) the arrival of the prioritized attack/riposte.

---

## 5. Important Distinction

Wrong interpretation:

"Tempóban végrehajtott közbetámadás elsőbbséget szerez."

Correct interpretation:

A tempóban végrehajtott közbetámadás may defeat an attack if:

- it hits before the final phase (the last move aimed directly at the intended target) of the attack is started
- and thus, it precedes the conclusion of the attack with at least one period of fencing time (vívóidő / tempó).

The counterattack does not gain priority.
It can exploit the attacker’s compound attacks (feints).

---

## 6. Practical Referee Evaluation Order

When both fencers hit:

1. Was there a valid initiated attack?
2. Was the attack continuous?
3. Was it parried?
4. Did the attack fail (fall-short, interruption, opposition)?

If yes to 1–2 and no interruption → attack has priority.

If the attack failed before its conclusion, or is preceded by a valid counterattack in time → no valid attack remains.
Counterattack may score.

The counterattack never creates priority by itself.

---

## 7. Cultural Clarification for Adult Fencers

Counterattacking in time is not a shortcut to priority.

You cannot "steal" right of way by being faster.

Priority is structural.

Tempo affects validity of the attack.
Tempo does not generate initiative.

---

## 8. Key Doctrinal Statement

Priority is transferred only by:

Attack → Parry → Immediate Riposte

Counterattacks do not transfer priority.
They only succeed when the attack collapses.
