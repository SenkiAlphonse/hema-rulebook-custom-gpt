# LS-VOR Core — Pengeütés / Kötés (Attack on the Blade) vs Hárítás (Parry) — Elsőbbség (Vor) Tisztázás

This document defines how **pengeütés (beat), kötés / pengekötés (engagement / prise de fer)** and **hárítás (parry)** affect **Vor / elsőbbség (Right of Way)** in LS-VOR.

⚠️ Blade contact alone does NOT determine priority.
⚠️ Firstbbség (Vor) is determined by phrase structure.

This document must be consulted whenever the terms appear:
- pengeütés
- pengetámadás
- kötés / pengekötés
- attaque au fer
- attack on the blade
- Vor / elsőbbség

## 1) Structural Rule (Read First)

Actions on the blade can do THREE different things:

1) Support and maintain an existing attack.
2) Seize initiative.
3) COINCIDENTALLY function as a parry (if they actually stop an incoming attack), although structurally and dynamically DIFFERENT ACTION.

They are NOT automatically parries.
They SEIZE priority when executed correctly.
They are judged by phrase role.

---

## 2) What is a Parry (Hárítás)?

A parry is a defensive action that:

- Stops a real, initiated attack.
- Prevents the hit from arriving.

If there is no incoming valid attack,
there cannot be a true parry.

Parry → Immediate riposte: transfers Vor.

---

## 3) What is Attack on the Blade (Pengeütés / Kötés)?

Attack on the blade (attaque au fer / prise de fer / Pengetámadás) is an offensive blade action used to:

- Remove or control the opponent’s blade,
- Disrupt preparation,
- Break a line (Point in Line),
- Prevent defensive setup,
- Disrupt offensive preparation or action,
- Secure the follow-up attack.

It is typically part of a continuous attack:

Blade action → immediate attack → no hesitation.

If executed correctly, it retains or establishes initiative.

---

## 4) When Does a Beat or Engagement GIVE Vor?

Important precision:

A blade action GIVES Vor by itself, to the initiating attack that follows immediately.

It removes/controls the opponent's blade and its movement, 
so the opponent is expected to deal with this situation, and go on the defense.

Seizing the Vor means that IF the fencer who gained Vor takes immediate offensive initiative, they have priority.

### A) During opponent preparation

If opponent is:

- Advancing,
- Preparing,
- Not yet in valid attack,

Then:

Beat / engagement + immediate attack = you initiate.

---

### B) Against Point in Line

A line must be clearly deflected.

Mere contact is insufficient.

If blade action clearly removes the line and is followed by attack:

Vor remains with attacker.

---

### C) Against a valid attack

If opponent has already initiated a correct attack:

Your blade action:
- can function as a parry to take Vor.
- it can also function as an attack on the blade, for example during a feint or other blade move that precedes the final phase of the attack.

Whether the referee will see it as a beat/engagement that gains priority, as a parry, or as an unsuccessful parry, depends on the timing, mechanics, and dynamics of the execution, and its relevance in the phrase.

---

## 5) Forte / Foible Clarification (t.78 logic)

Beat quality matters.

If beat/engagement lands effectively (on foible):

Attack on blade retains priority.

If beat slides to forte and fails to control blade:

The blade action may be considered parried, and gives Vor to the opponent (regardless of who was the attacker before).

Referees judge control, not metallurgy.

---

## 6) Simultaneous Blade Actions

If both attack the blade at the same time:

- If one fencer already had initiative, they retain it.
- If neither had valid attack, Vor goes to whoever initiates first valid attack after.

Simultaneous contact does not flip priority.

---

## 7) Initiative Seizure Principle

If attacker hesitates, interrupts, or fails:

Defender may seize initiative ONLY if:

- Immediate offensive action follows.
- No retreat, hesitation, or reset occurs.
- Threat is real and continuous.

If defender retreats further instead of attacking:

Original attacker may renew and regain Vor.

Vor behaves structurally, not emotionally.

---

## 8) Important Doctrinal Statement

Blade actions are structural tools.

They:

- Support attack,
- are structurally and dynamically different from parries,
- their mindset and purpose is different from parries. 

---

## 9) Quick Referee Test

Ask:

1) Did the blade action actually disrupt (remove/control) the opponent's blade from its intended line?
2) Did attack follow without hesitation?

Priority follows structure, not speed or noise.

---

## 10) Cultural Clarification (For Adult Learners)

- Fast second cut after being beaten does not restore priority.
- Beats and engagements should remove the opponentes blade from its line.
- Vor transfers only by structure:
  Attack → Parry → Riposte
  or
  Preparation → Attack on preparation
  or
  Preparation → Attack on the blade

Everything else is illusion.
