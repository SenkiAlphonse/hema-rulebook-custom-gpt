# REF Core — Immediate Riposte vs Renewed Attack (Priority Clarification)

This document clarifies the distinction between:

- Immediate riposte (prioritised)
- Delayed riposte (priority lost)
- Renewed attack after being parried

This logic is relevant for refereeing in the VOR variant.

Speed alone does NOT determine priority.
Initiative structure determines priority.

## 1. Effect of a Valid Parry

After a valid parry:

- The original attack is finished.
- The defender gains right of way.
- The attacker no longer has initiative.

Any subsequent offensive action by the original attacker is a renewed attack, not a continuation.

This applies regardless of how fast the renewed action is executed, and even if a renewed attack hits before the ripost does--similarly to how counterattacks vs attacks are evaluated: riposts have priority just like attacks. 

---

## 2. Immediate Riposte (Valid, With Priority)

A riposte is considered immediate when:

1. It follows continuously from the parry.
2. There is no visible hesitation.
3. There is no reset of guard or arm withdrawal.

The defender may:

- Advance while riposting.
- Lengthen the action if the opponent retreats.
- Take multiple steps if the action remains continuous.

Distance extension does NOT cancel priority.

What matters is continuity of offensive intent.

Referee call example:

"Parry, riposte — attack from the right."

---

## 3. Delayed Riposte (Priority Lost)

A riposte loses priority if, after the parry, the defender:

- Pauses,
- Hesitates,
- Withdraws the arm,
- Resets distance,
- Begins a new preparatory action before attacking.

In this case, the original right of way is abandoned.

The opponent may then launch a renewed attack and regain priority.

It is also possible that the renewed attack precedes the ripost by one period of fencing time, in that case the riposte, even if it would have priority, is irrelevant. This might happen during correct compound ripostes.

Referee call example:

"Parry — no riposte — attack from the left."

## 4. Renewed Attack After Being Parried

If the attacker:

- Attacks,
- Is parried,
- Immediately cuts again,

The second cut is NOT a continuation of the first attack.

It is a renewed attack.

Even if:

- It was premeditated,
- It is extremely fast,
- It visually begins before the riposte is fully extended.

Priority does not depend on milliseconds.
It depends on fencing time sequence.

If the riposte is immediate and continuous,
the renewed attack has no priority.

---

## 5. Retreat During Riposte

If the defender:

- Finishes the last retreat step with the parry,
- Immediately transitions into riposte,

Priority remains valid.

However, if the defender:

- Parries,
- Then begins a new retreat,
- And only afterwards attacks,

The riposte is delayed and loses priority.

The retreat may conclude the defensive phase.
A new retreat after the parry breaks continuity.

---

## 6. One Fencing Time Principle

Priority transfer is based on fencing time, not visible speed.

Sequence:

Attack → Parry → Immediate Riposte

This is structurally correct even if the renewed attack appears physically fast.

If a tempo break occurs between parry and riposte,
priority may shift.

---

## 7. Practical Referee Evaluation Order

After a parry, ask:

1. Was the parry valid?
2. Did the defender begin offensive action immediately?
3. Was there visible hesitation or reset?
4. Was the action continuous despite distance changes?

If yes to 1–2 and no to 3 → riposte has priority.

If hesitation occurred → renewed attack may gain priority.

---

## 8. Key Cultural Clarification

Two very fast cuts do not equal continuous attack.

Once parried, the attack is over.

Speed cannot replace lost initiative.

The correct principle is:

Initiative is transferred by structure, not by speed.
